    memory segment to be allocated. The return value for this function is a pointer to the
    shared memory area which has been attached (and possibly created) by this function. If,
    for some reason, this function cannot connect to the shared memory area as requested,
    it shall return a NULL pointer. *** A program using this library function must be able to use it
    to attach the maximum number of shared memory segments to the calling process. ***
    (Note that Solaris 10 does not have a limit to the number of attachments, so you can use
    the limit that Linux supports â€“ use the limit you find on our Linux server
    absaroka.apl.jhu.edu).
